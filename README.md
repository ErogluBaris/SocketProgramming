# SocketProgramming
 
This class is used for performing server or client in communicating systems.

Actually I used that class to perform "Relay Network" system that makes wifi communication better between devices. And this system is used in a Smart Home.
Since the wifi signal can be low in rooms that are away from modem, they can't transmit or receice data successfully.
Thanks to this relay network system, devices can send or receive their data by other devices which can connect modem successfully.

# Project
In my project, I try to use smart plugs at home and send their data to a control system, which is an API. This code is used for testing the relay network.

But also this code can be used in ESP8266 wifi modules with micropython.(But the libraries should be change...)
